GIS_GPS_Datalogger
==================

Welcome, and thank you for checking out my Arduino-based multi-sensor GPS data logger project designed for use GIS-based applications.

What is this?

The overall goal of this project is to use ArcGIS and spatial datasets to solve a problem or, at the very least, output some useful conclusions about something. There is plenty of geospatial referenced data available online, but I felt it would be more interesting to collect the data myself. I needed a way to quickly gather large amounts of meaningful data and associate it with the location from which it was collected. 

With that goal in mind, this project quickly evolved into designing, creating, and using an Arduino-based GPS data logging device and a number of electronic environmental sensors to collect the data and save it in a format which can be easily imported into ArcGIS for further exploration and analysis.

What's here?
This repository will be the home for my device designs, the code needed to get them working, and possibly some notes and interesting results.
